        <h3>Basic of C++</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>C++ in 1979 by Bjarne Strowstrup</li>
            <li>It is a fast n more controllable and high performance language</li>
            <li>c++11, c++14, c++17</li>
            <li><b>Streams:</b> Sequence of bytes corresponding to input or output</li>
            <li><b>Input Streams:</b> Directions of flow of bytes from input device (ex keyboard) to the main memory</li>
            <li><b>Output Streams:</b> Direction of flow of bytes from main memory to output device (ex Display)</li>
            <li>"<<" is called insertion operator(cout)</li>
            <li>">>" is called Extraction operator(cin)</li>
            <li>In c++ typecasting, int(b) is same as (int)b.</li>
            <li>We can use const keyword in c++ to make the variable immutable(can't change)</li>
            <li>(g++ -o pointer.exe pointer.cpp) to create our own exe file.</li>
            <li><b>#include (
                bits/stdc++.h>)</b></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="variables">
        <h3>Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A container to hold data.</li>
            <li>Scope of a variable is the region in code where the existence of variable is valid.</li>
            <li>Local variables get precedance over global.</li>
            <li>To access global variable, we can use scope resolution(::) before it like ::c</li>
            <li>
                <b>Types</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><u>Local</u> (declared inside braces and can be accessed from there only)</li>
                    <li><u>Global</u> (declared outside the function and can be accessed from anywhere)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Variable Types</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>int</li>
                    <li>char</li>
                    <li>float</li>

                <b>Rules to declare variables</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>var names can range from 1 to 255 characters</li>
                    <li>begin with letters or underscore</li>
                    <li>can contain digits in between name</li>
                    <li>case sensitive</li>
                    <li>no spaces or special characters allowed</li>
                    <li>can't use keyword as variable names</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>To speciy whether the a no.( say 34.4) is float or long double, we can use it like 34.4f and 34.4l</li>

            <h3>Why OOPs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>C++ mainly designed to add object-oriented features to C.</li>
                <li>As program size increases, readability, maintainibility and bug free nature of Program decreases. Since C relied on function or procedures(Procedural oriented programming), so possibility of not addressing the problem in effective manner was very high.</li>
                <li>Also, as data was almost neglected, so data security was easily compromised.(Any function can use any data.)</li>
                <li>Using classes solve this problem.</li>

                <li><u>Dynamic Binding:</u> Code which will execute is not known until the program runs.</li>

            <h3>Benifits of OOPs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Better code reusability using Objects and Inheritance.</li>
                <li>Data hiding helps build secure systems.</li>
                <li>Multiple objects can coexist without any interference.</li>
                <li>Software complexity can be easily managed.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <li>Classes are extension of structure(in C).</li>
        <li>
            Structure had limitations in C=> 
            <ul>
                <li>Members are public, No data hiding.</li>
                <li>Functions can not be included in Structures.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>In c++, structures are typedefed.</li>
        <li>Object can be declared along with the class declaration unlike in structures in c. For ex, class fruit{} mango, apple; </li>
        <li>Private data members can be accessed by using function of that class only by assigning values. They can not be accesses directly by using dot operator.</li>
        <li>Scopeof static variable is within the class.</li>
        <li>Lifespan is till program terminates.</li>
        <li>Static function is created to access only static objects.</li>
        <li>if data is input then no matter call by value and call by reference but it matters when data is passed. Values will not be swapped if & is not used, bcz in this case only formal parameters are changed.</li>
        <li>Enum serve the purpose of representing a group of named constants in a programming language</li>
        <li>Enum(X,Y,Z) is equivalent to const X=10,const Y=23; const Z=2;</li>
        <li><b>process.h</b>It includes functions for creating new processes, managing their execution and termination, and obtaining information about currently running processes.</li>
        <div class="friend">
            <h3>Friend Function</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Friend function is not in the scope of class and so can not be called from the object of the class. For ex, c1.sumComplex()=> Invalid</li>

                                    <li><u>Sequence Containers</u> = Store in linear fashion. For ex, Vectors, List,  Dequeue</li>
                                    <li><u>Associative Containers</u> = Direct access. Designed such that provide fast access.All operation are fast except random access. For ex, Set, Multiset, map, Multimap </li>
                                    <li><u>Derived Containers</u> = may be derived from both of above, Real world modelling. Fast or slow depends. For ex, Stack, Queue, priority-queue</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>

                    </li>
                    <li><b>Algorithms</b> (Procedure to process data, like sorting , searching, use template functions)</li>
                    <li><b>Iterators</b> (Object points to an element in a container, connect algorithm with container, Handeled like pointers.)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Vectors</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dynamic arrays with the ability to resize themselves automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.</li>
                    <li>Random access is fast</li>
                    <li>Insertion/Deletion is slow in middle</li>
                    <li>Insertion at the end is fast.</li>
                    <li>Include header file-> #include vector></li>

                <b>Lists</b>
                <ul>
                    <ul>allow non contiguous(non consecutive) memory allocation.</ul>
                    <li>Random access is slow (bcz iteration through pointers).</li>
                    <li>middle insertion is fast.</li>
                    <li>insertion is fast at end.</li>

    <li>Function Objects(Functors): Function wrapped in a class so that it is available as an object.</li>
    <li>To get these function objects we use #include functional</li>
    <li>To use sorting algorithm, we use #include algorithm</li>
    <li>conio.h header file used in C programming language contains functions for console input/output. Some of its most commonly used functions are clrscr, getch, getche, kbhit etc</li>
